#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

>  The vtkMassProperties class can calculate the surface area and volume of triangular meshes, but the mesh must be closed triangular mesh data. For non-triangular meshes, the mesh needs to be converted to triangular mesh data. vtkTriangleFilter can convert polygonal mesh data to triangular mesh data. The use of this class is very simple, just set the vtkPolyData mesh data that needs to be converted as input.
