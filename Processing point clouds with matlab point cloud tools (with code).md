#  Using matlab to process point clouds 

 This paper mainly shares the use of MATLAB point cloud tools to deal with point clouds, and simple estimation and measurement of point cloud volume through point cloud contour.

###  2.1 Point cloud reading and display 

 Suppose you have a point cloud file named pointcloud.ply - Introduction to the ply format 

  ```python

  ```  
 Here it is important to note that the header file in the.ply file is formatted like this: 

  ```python

  ```  
 Where x, y, x are the spatial coordinates of the three-dimensional point cloud, followed by b, g, r represent the color of each point, the latter item is very important for texture mapping and display, can be extracted separately, and then displayed with pcshow; 

 Pcread generated after reading the file

 We can extract the position and color of it to texture map and paint

 Here is an example of using point cloud data generated by CMVS/PMVS methods:     

###  2.2 Processing of point clouds 

 In order to obtain the volume of this building, its volume is obtained by obtaining the contour envelope of this building. Mainly use the alphaShape function and volum in matlab 

 alphaShape This function is mainly used to extract edges from discrete 3D space point clouds and establish corresponding envelopes: shp = alphaShape (x, y, z) 

>  The main control parameters are alpha values, which are used to control the fineness of the production contour (the smaller the more delicate) 'RegionThreshold' ignores the small objects in the generated envelope, and presses the threshold volume of the small object'HoleThreshold 'to fill the holes in the envelope to generate a complete volume morph- * alphaShape (x, y, z, alpha,' HoleThreshold ', xx,' RegionThreshold ', xx) 

 It is important to note that the position coordinates of the point cloud need to be converted to a double-precision type.

 The image above shows the generated point cloud envelope (requiring careful conditional parameters to generate an envelope that meets the required accuracy), and the approximate volume of this envelope can be calculated through volum.
