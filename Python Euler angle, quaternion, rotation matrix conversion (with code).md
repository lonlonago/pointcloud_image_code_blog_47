#  III. Display of results 

   Take the conversion of the classical RPY Euler angle as an example and compare it with the results of the calculation tool. The following is the code calculation result: 

>  Euler angle to quaternion [[0.70710678 -0.70710678 0.] [0.70710678 0.70710678 0.] [0.0.1.] Euler angle to quaternion [0.0.0.38268343 0.92387953]

 This is the calculation result of the calculation tool. It can be seen that the code is exactly the same as the rotation matrix calculated by the calculation tool; the output order of the quaternions in the code is: w, x, y, z (w is the imaginary part, x, y, z is the real part),
