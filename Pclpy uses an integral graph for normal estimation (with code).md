##  1. Algorithm overview 

   Integral image is a method for performing normal estimation on ordered point clouds. The algorithm treats the point cloud as a depth image and creates certain rectangular regions on which the normals are calculated by taking into account the relationship between adjacent "pixels" (points) without running lookups on a search structure such as a KD tree. Therefore, its computational efficiency is very high, and the normals can usually be calculated in an instant. Therefore, it is best to use this method for real-time computation of ordered point clouds acquired from RGB-D sensors. Note: This method is only applicable to ordered point clouds!!!
