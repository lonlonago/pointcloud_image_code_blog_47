#  I. Overview 

   Pclpy is a Python implementation of the point cloud library PCL. The point cloud reading function that comes with pclpy does not support reading point clouds under the Chinese path. Pclpy contains laspy, so pclpy supports processing point clouds in las format. 

##  1. Read the point cloud
